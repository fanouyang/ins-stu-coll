### Appendix for the manuscript: 
“Did the instructor and students build collaboration during online asynchronous discussions?”

1.The excerpts of a cognitive turn-taking discourse.
[Turn No. 0]
Danielle initiated a topic about re-contextualizing online learning community by introducing information and resources. 
Along with the introduction, she proposed some prompting questions to trigger further inquiry.	

Example: …An interesting topic to discuss this week is re-contextualizing community… We need to rethink some things in order 
to understand what’s necessary to build community in an online space. We should also consider the human side of online 
learning: it explores how we can humanize online learning, what does that mean, … what goes into connecting as real human 
beings online, not just the technological tools that we have access to but the human being on the other side at the computer 
screen that you’re connecting to. (Danielle, KEX & QER, Instructional Video, Week 3)
	
[Turn No. 1]
Several students presented their perspectives on the influence of technology on online learning communities; other students 
extended and deepened those perspectives with elaborations, supports of resources, or personal experiences.	

Example: I disagree with this quote from Page 35 in the book Building Online Learning Communities by Palloff and Pratt, 
Chapter 2: “does familiarity with all of these forms of technology assist younger students to form community in online? Our 
opinion is that is does not”. I disagree this statement, I think technology is important for students to build online 
communities because without technologies, how can one person connect with others online? (A student Shawn, KEL, Discussion 
Thread, Week 3)

[Turn No. 2]
Example: I guess I can see both sides. On the one hand, many students clearly have no problem using technology, 
but creating learning communities online isn’t the same as just posting on Facebook. Although they can obviously 
get online and navigate, I wonder if their constant use of technology changes their definition of community to be 
something much more casual than the definition we’re talking about in class. Maybe one way to think of it is the 
difference between “hard skills” (being able to navigate online) and “soft skills” (being able to think deeply and 
contribute meaningfully to a discussion). (A student Katie, KEL, Discussion Thread, Week 3)
	
[Turn No. 3]
Danielle also engaged in the discussion about Palloff and Pratt textbook, and further pointed out a sub-topic - the 
humanized aspect of online learning - to trigger cognitive inquiry.	

Example: … I often disagree with assertions made by Palloff and Pratt as well. They are considered the some of the most 
highly respected scholars in the area of online learning communities and social presence... and you will see them cited 
in other literature all over the place. However, I think they miss the point on the humanized aspect of online learning, 
which I’m looking forward to learn more and discuss with you all in the near future… (Danielle, KEX, Discussion Thread, 
Week 3)
	
[Turn No. 4]
Some students continued the discussion by proposing questions about the humanized aspect of online learning and its influences
on younger people, and also reflected on how the questions were formed in terms of their own experiences.	

Example: … Regarding the humanized aspect, I have some questions about younger students and their involvement in online 
communities. I feel conflicted by the author’s brief dismissal of younger students with very little research behind their 
claims. What are we missing in examining these students as potential online learners? With my experiences, younger students 
might not be well equipped with technology use or may be over exposure…They will be pushed into online learning very soon and 
how can we prepare them to handle this level of involvement. (A student Paul, QER & MCL, Discussion Thread, Week 3)
	
[Turn No. 5]
This discussion ended at Danielle’s reflection via a summary video presented in the following week’s class agenda, where she 
summarized students’ thoughts, raised up student’s knowledge, and advanced collective knowledge.	

Example: … talking about social aspect of online learning, something that I thought was interesting that one group posted was 
have the level of fear, vulnerability that accompanies and when we let ourselves be seen and make connections with others. 
I think that is significant in the physical spaces but it may be amplified in online spaces, because initially when we come 
together with other group members in an online class or other communities, we don’t know one another well and so how does 
community develop when the members don’t necessarily know one another well. I think it takes a lot of efforts on the part of 
the facilitator to design activities and things to bring people together so that they start to get to know one another. 
(Danielle, KEL & MT, Summary Video, Week 4)	

2.The excerpts of a teaching turn-taking discourse.
[Turn No. 0]
Five students (Francie, Jennifer, Shawn, Tracy, and Yu) autonomously formed a student learning team to collectively design 
and facilitate a weekly class session. They collectively decided the topic Gamification and one of them (Jennifer) initiated 
a first version of class agenda via a Google doc for the team members to work on.

Example: The team members collectively contributed to the outline in class agenda, including images, learning goals, 
and readings; they also shared this Google doc with the instructor Danielle. (A student learning team, DO, Class Agenda, 
Week 10) 	

[Turn No. 1]
Danielle provided some feedbacks about the team’s choice of discussion topic and relevant design via Google doc comments.

Example: It’s a fascinating topic! Look forward for your activity design of this topic! If you need any help, feel free to 
let me know … (Danielle, AS, Class Agenda comments, Week 10) 

[Turn No. 2]
The student team continued to optimize the learning activities by creating an online badge activity	

Example: I have found an interesting badge resource to add to the optional resources. Maybe it will make up a bit for our 
badge-awarding idea not working out as well as we’d hoped. I also looked over the pages, and apart from the change Jennifer 
mentioned, I think they look great. (A student learning team, DO, Class Agenda, Week 10)

[Turn No. 3]
Danielle then tried to embed the badge in Ning forum and provided some feedback about the badge appearance in Ning.

Example: I am doing my best to get this working on our Ning site…I have tried just about everything I can think of to upload 
a new graphic to customize the Badge, to no avail... I have had to ask the Ning Tech Help folks for assistance because it’s 
been a bit glitchy. Unfortunately, our Ning site was built on Ning 2.0 and Ning has since upgraded to 3.0. The 3.0 version 
is still in beta and does not yet have some of the features that we use in our course, so I have resisted upgrading for now. 
I will try other ways to do this… (Danielle, AS, Class Agenda comments, Week 10)

[Turn No. 4]
Based on the instructor’s feedback, students tried different technique solutions and revised the badge activity.	

Example: Thanks for all your work on the badge part - I had tried several options in Ning… I moved the Badge to a more 
prominent place in the right column of our Ning site, directly under the message center… the profile pic also appears in 
the Badge and is foregrounded against any image you upload - that cannot be changed either… (A student learning team, DO, 
Class Agenda comments, Week 10)

[Turn No. 5]
The student team continued to discuss prompting questions in class agenda that would be used to trigger cognitive engagement.	

Example: … As part of your online community blog post for the week, answer these questions: Are gamification elements used 
in your chosen online community? If so, what are they? If not, do you think your online community would benefit from 
gamification elements? (A student learning team, DO, Class Agenda, Week 10)

[Turn No. 6]
Danielle made some suggestions about prompting questions.	

Example: You may consider to make the questions more open-ended, very much like what I posted in previous weeks… in this 
way, they may trigger more students’ cognitive engagement in this weekly discussion… (Danielle, AS, Class Agenda comments, 
Week 10)

[Turn No. 7]
The student team finalized the discussion topic, activity design and prompting questions, for example, they added new 
open-ended questions.	

Example: As part of your online community blog post for the week, answer these questions: Are gamification elements used in 
your chosen online community? If so, what are they? How well do they work for you? If not, do you think your online community 
would benefit from gamification elements? Which ones might work well? (A student learning team, DO, Class Agenda, Week 10) 

[Turn No. 8]
Danielle reminded the student team to ensure that the discussion post and relevant resources and activities appeared the way
they wanted.	

Example: To make sure they appear as you would like them to, please go ahead and create your discussion forums for week 10. 
You have permissions on Ning to add discussion forums…just click on “+Add” in the upper right. Be sure to give them titles 
that are clear… since we have lots of forums so far this semester. (Danielle, DO & AS, Class Agenda comments, Week 10) 

[Turn No. 9]
The student team posted the discussion post and relevant resources and activities in Ning forum.

Example: Please read this article: Gamification in Education: What, How, Why Bother?... Respond to these questions in the 
Week 10 Discussion Forum: What did you find interesting about gamification as described in the article? Is gamification what 
you thought it was? How does gamification differ from actually using games?... (A student learning team, DF, Discussion 
Thread, Week 10) 

[Turn No. 10]
Danielle checked the class agenda and discussion post in Ning site and reminded the student team to make sure its accuracy.	

Example: Please review this closely for any errors and ensure all links are working correctly. I believe they are, but I’d 
like you check as well. (Danielle, DO, Class Agenda, Week 10)	

3.The excerpts of a social turn-taking discourse.
[Turn No. 0]
Danielle and students first collectively created a class charter to build on guidelines of interaction, communication and 
collaboration in this online course. One of the agreements they built together was to emphasize the importance of timing of 
postings and the formats.	

Example: … Be mindful of the timing of your postings or contributions to the discussions and to group work; respond and 
participate in a timely manner. Remember that your course colleagues or group members are reliant upon you for interaction 
in the discussion and to complete group tasks (Danielle & Students, IC, Class Charter, Week 1).
	
[Turn No. 1]
Sticking with this agreement, a student Paul posted his schedule in one weekly discussion to explain why he would participate
late.	

Example: … Shawn, I saw that same quote… this really struck me, almost blindsided me, because this generation is so immersed 
in technology, but may be too immature to deal with it. I look forward to talking about this tonight. Once I get the kids 
to bed my night frees up, so if I am not online by 8 pm it should be shortly there after (A student Paul, ES & IC, Discussion 
Thread, Week 3)
	
[Turn No. 2]
In the same discussion thread, Danielle acknowledged Paul’s action for sticking with the agreement and encouraged other 
students to do the same if there were time conflicts.	

Example: … I also wanted to thank you, Paul, for leaving a note like this for your group to let them know you’ll be 
back online later tonight to finish up this week’s discussion. Needing to step away for a bit to focus on other things 
will happen for all of us at different points in the course, for a variety of reasons. But to connect like this to give 
others a heads-up if you can is going to be really helpful as you depend on one another to accomplish other activities and 
tasks together as a group in the weeks ahead (Danielle, RE & IC, Discussion Thread, Week 3)

[Turn No. 3]
Danielle not only acknowledged students’ actions on sticking with the agreement, but also did the same to students: she 
explained why she posted the video late. 	

Example: … I really appreciate your patience in getting this video posted a bit late today. I have had a lot of things 
come to my schedule that were unexpected this morning. I’m always flexible and understanding with you in regard to things 
coming up that we couldn’t have envisioned. So I just appreciate you being patient with me. (Danielle, ES & CP, Instructional 
Video, Week 4)

[Turn No. 4]
Sticking with the agreement, another student Jill explained why she choose to participate in the written format rather than 
video/audio format in a following week’s discussion.

Example: … Hi Everyone, I’m in a coffee shop, so I am opting to write (both for privacy and bandwidth), but isn’t this the 
fun of taking an online class - you can do it in a coffee shop! (A student Jill, ES & CP, Discussion Thread, Week 8)	

[Turn No. 5]
Then, Danielle appreciated that students acted according to the guidelines they built together in the class charter.

Example: … thank you all for sticking with the agreement we made in the first week’s class charter and acted in terms of our 
guidelines. (Danielle, RE & CP, Summary Video, Week 14)

[Turn No. 6]
Finally, several students acknowledged the effectiveness of co-creating a class charter for building a social, supportive 
environment.	

Example: … I think the class charter gave me a good idea of what to expect and what was going to be expected throughout the 
class. I also think it gave me an idea of what others expected out of each other and the teacher. (A student Ellie, RE, 
Discussion Thread, Week 14)	

4.The excerpts of an interweaving cognitive, teaching and social turn-taking discourse.
[Turn No. 0]
Danielle facilitated weekly discussion by proposing prompting questions about online learning community .

Example: … This week we will work on the basic concepts of community. How do you define or envision “online community” or 
“online learning community”? What does it look like? Feel like? or Why do you believe/not believe community is important in 
online spaces? In particular, online learning spaces? (Danielle, DF & QER, Discussion Thread, Week 2)

[Turn No. 1]
Then, students made a comparison between a physical face-to-face learning environment she experienced before with her 
expectations of learning experiences in online learning communities.

Example: … When an online community really works, perhaps it can draw its participants back inside again and again in 
the same way as the student room in the East Asian Studies department did when I was an undergrad. It became a place people 
want to be for interesting discussion and encouragement and learning… I would like to learn more about how online environments
can nourish this type of connections… (A student Tracy, KEL, Discussion Thread, Week 2)

[Turn No. 2]
Danielle deepened the differences of face-to-face community and online community, and then she proposed a sub-topic about 
embodiment in online learning that connected learning in face-to-face contexts and online communities.	

Example: … Hi Tracy, the way you’ve described the physical space of the East Asian Studies student room sounds like it was 
very inviting… That organic or intrinsic desire or motivation is really key to drawing people in to a community space I think,
whether it be physical or online… Do you think it’s possible that an online learning environment may, in some ways, afford 
more opportunity to do this...? (Danielle, KEL & QER & IC, Discussion Thread, Week 2)

[Turn No. 3]
The student then expressed her interest on this sub-topic of embodiment and her desire to learn more about this sub-topic.	

Example: … Danielle, it is a great topic. I would like to learn more about ways to construct online spaces that nourish 
that sort of inviting environment that feels appealing, supportive, and challenging, so that students develop the intrinsic 
motivation to log on often - to see our friends and colleagues and learn something new from each other… (A student Tracy, 
IC & KEX & MCL, Discussion Thread, Week 2)
	
[Turn No. 4]
Taking students’ request into consideration, Danielle in the next week’s discussion added an optional article about Rethinking
Bodies, which very closely related to embodiment.

Example: … in your base group, you can collective decide to discuss one of the following readings… the first optional article 
is Rethinking Bodies in the Traditional Classroom (Greenhalgh-Spencer, 2012)… (Danielle, DO & CP, Class Agenda, Week 3)	

[Turn No. 5]
After reading the article on Rethinking Bodies, other students continued to extend their perspectives and further expressed 
their interests on this topic.	

Example: … I enjoyed the “Rethinking Bodies” article much more than the other readings... I thought the author provides a 
compelling refutation to the notion that online learning is inferior to traditional classroom, face-to-face learning. The 
keys to effective learning, in my view, are a teacher who knows her subject and students who are motivated enough to invest 
the time necessary to learn. The author cites several critics who maintain that online learning is inferior, but that claim 
is now outdated as major, highly regarded institutions of learning now offer courses and programs online. (A student Natt, 
KEL & ES, Discussion Thread, Week 3)

[Turn No. 6]
Danielle appreciated students’ input on the sub-topic and also reflected on her pedagogical strategy of integrating students’ 
emerging interest in discussion design.	

Example: … I appreciate your impressions of the Rethinking Bodies article, Natt. I also found it very compelling, although 
I realize not everyone enjoys or really connects with philosophy. :)  I’ve always been pretty practically-oriented in my work,
but very recently I’ve started to become intrigued by more philosophical literature. Considering your educational and 
professional background, I’m not surprised that this article was particularly interesting to you. I’ll try to continue to 
provide both practical and theoretical options in the readings to meet the wide variety of interests we have among us in this 
class. Thanks for sharing your thoughts here. :) (Danielle, IC & RE & MT, Discussion Thread, Week 3)

[Turn No. 7]
Danielle deepened the sub-topic of embodiment in online learning with detailed explanations in the summary video.	

Example: … You all made a rich conversation last week together…I wanted to go back and talk about the rethinking bodies 
article that I shared… the author recounts the criticism of online education. I share that concern. I think sometimes online 
learning is discounted… somehow dehumanized or impersonal. That hasn’t been my experience at all. I think that as you do 
build community, it does give a humanized feel to it… I believe that comes through in online learning environments, when 
they’re designed well, when they’re facilitated well… Future directions for this research include further exploration into 
phenomenological significance of virtual space as lived space or embodied space… embodiment emphasizes connections between 
the world and the body. The notion of lived space as embodied space is compelling when it’s considered in the context of 
virtual space or lived experiences in virtual learning spaces… for human beings living in the world embodiment means being 
present and therefore connected to the world as the body inhabits lived space. (Danielle, KEL & RE & CP, Summary Video, Week 3)
